The rapid adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) presents both opportunities and challenges for infrastruc-
ture planning. This project focuses on optimizing the placement and number of EV chargers across
Washington State, with the primary objective of maximize total charging capacity per hour, secondary
objective of reducing environmental impact, and the tertiary objectives of minimizing cost.

Project Goal
The key focus of the project is on determining the optimal locations for EV charging stations and the
optimal number of each type of chargers by solving an optimization problem. This will serve as a
benchmark to evaluate the efficiency of WA’s current charging infrastructure.

Significance of the Problem
Washington holds the second-highest EV market share in the U.S., with EVs comprising 10% of all
vehicle registrations1. The state is on track to meet ambitious zero-emission vehicle targets, requiring
68% of new cars to be pollution-free by 2030 and 100% by 20352. Despite this progress, critical challenges
mentioned below still remain: 
  • Unknown efficiency in resource allocation: It is unclear if the current distribution of chargers
  is effectively meeting demand or minimizing underutilization.
  • Potential inefficient location strategy: Poorly located charging stations may not serve high-
  demand areas or key routes, leading to inefficiencies.
  • Environmental consideration: Excessive deployment of hardware can increase carbon footprint
  and material waste.

The problem’s complexity makes it a valuable study in balancing environmental, economic, and operational factors. This project tackles a real-world challenge with significant implications for sustainable transportation.
By applying optimization techniques to Washington’s EV landscape, it offers practical solutions to inform infrastructure investment and policy decisions.
